    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is my very first HTML webpage created from scratch. I'm excited to learn web development and build amazing
        projects.</p>

    <h2>Why I'm Learning Web Development</h2>
    <p>The internet has become an essential part of our lives, and being able to create content for it is an incredibly
        valuable skill. I want to understand how websites work and eventually build my own applications.</p>

    <h3>What I've Learned So Far</h3>
    <p>I've started with the basics of HTML, learning about tags, elements, and document structure. Next, I'll be diving
        into CSS to make my pages look more professional.</p>

    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>By the end of this learning journey, I hope to build a complete portfolio website showcasing my projects. I'm
        particularly interested in creating interactive web applications.</p>
